# Lists
## Problem 1

## Problem 11

  Modified run-length encoding.

Modify the result of problem 10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.

Example:

```hs
Î»>  encodeModified "aaaabccaadeeee"
    [Multiple 4 'a',Single 'b',Multiple 2 'c',
     Multiple 2 'a',Single 'd',Multiple 4 'e']
```

[Solution](./11.encodeModified.hs)
